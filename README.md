# AudioAssist
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered communication aid for people with speech difficulties like dysarthria. The model will solely use audio data captured through a microphone, analyze speech patterns with machine learning algorithms, and generate a text output. The goal is to enable effective communication without additional hardware. The project will utilize Python and Tensorflow.
